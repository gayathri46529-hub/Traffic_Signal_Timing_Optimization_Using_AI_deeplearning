#Traffic Signal Timing Optimization Using AI Deep Learning

#Project Overview

Traffic congestion is a common problem in urban areas. This project uses Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning to classify traffic conditions based on vehicle counts and time-related information.

The system predicts the traffic condition as Low, Normal, High, or Heavy and recommends a suitable green-light duration. A Python Tkinter GUI is provided to make the system easy to use.

#Objectives

Predict traffic conditions using a Deep Learning model.

Use vehicle-count and time-based features for prediction.

Recommend green-light duration according to the predicted traffic condition.

Provide a simple graphical user interface for users.

Demonstrate an AI-based approach for traffic signal management.

#Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Tkinter

Joblib

Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub

#Input Features

The system uses the following inputs:

Car Count

Bike Count

Bus Count

Truck Count

Total Vehicle Count

Hour

Day

#Traffic Classification

The trained model classifies traffic into different conditions:

Traffic Condition

#Recommended Green Time

Low

20 seconds

Normal

40 seconds

High

60 seconds

Heavy

90 seconds

#Graphical User Interface

The project includes a Tkinter-based GUI where the user can enter vehicle counts, hour, and day.

The system then displays the predicted traffic condition and recommended green-light duration.

#How to Run

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/gayathri46529-hub/Traffic_Signal_Timing_Optimization_Using_AI_deeplearning.git

2. Open the Project Folder

cd Traffic_Signal_Timing_Optimization_Using_AI_deeplearning

3. Activate the Python Environment

Activate your Python virtual environment if you have one configured.

4. Install Required Packages

pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib

5. Run the GUI

python traffic_gui.py

#Results

The developed system successfully predicts different traffic conditions and provides corresponding green-light duration recommendations through the graphical interface.

The GUI was tested with different vehicle-count combinations for Low, High, and Heavy traffic conditions.

#Future Improvements

Integrate real-time traffic camera data.

Use live traffic sensor information.

Develop adaptive signal timing based on real-time conditions.

Improve the model using a larger and more diverse traffic dataset.

Integrate the system with multiple traffic intersections.
